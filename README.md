# Mr. Cow

## About

Mr. Cow is a puzzle game. The goal is to get to the big pile of hay.
However, there are spikes in front of it, so you must first remove those by pressing the
three buttons, which are located around the level.
Angry wolves are patrolling along two of the paths, so be careful not to get too close to them!
If you do, the game is over.
After pressing all three buttons, you can now access the hay. Avoid the wolves again to reach it
and claim your victory!
